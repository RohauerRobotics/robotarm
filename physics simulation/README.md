# Physics Sim
This is a physics simulation of a three joint robot arm that I am in the process of making. The purpose of this simulation was originally just to estimate the torque requirement on the stepper motors but it has turned into a fully animated 3D simulation. This simulation is still in development and has become a crutial component of my robot design, providing verification for the image recognition and path planning. This is a version modified from the current working version to demonstrate serveral capabilities, but I may continue development of this a seperate project.
